** Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of Programming Languages: Early languages like Fortran and C++ laid the groundwork for modern programming, enabling developers to write more efficient and complex software.
2. Formal Recognition of Software Engineering: The establishment of software engineering as a discipline emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, emphasizing the need for structured approaches to manage software complexity.
3. Advent of Structured Programming (1970s): This milestone focused on improving software design by promoting modular programming and clearer control structures, enhancing code maintainability and reducing errors.
4. Rise of Agile and Scrum Methodologies (2001): Agile methodologies transformed software development by prioritizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback over traditional, linear methods, allowing teams to deliver value rapidly and adapt to change.


** List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes seven key phases that provide a structured approach to developing software:

1. Planning: This phase defines the project’s goals, scope, and feasibility. It involves meetings with stakeholders to gather requirements and create a project plan with timelines and resources.
2. Requirements Analysis: Here, detailed requirements—both functional and non-functional—are collected from stakeholders and documented to clarify what the software should achieve.
3. Design: This phase creates the software's architecture. It includes designing user interfaces, database structures, and system integrations, ensuring alignment with the requirements.
4. Implementation: Developers write the code according to the design specifications. This step involves creating, testing, and integrating all software components.
5. Testing: The implemented software is rigorously tested to find and fix defects. This includes various testing types such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure it works correctly.
6. Deployment: After successful testing, the software is delivered to users. This may involve training users and establishing support systems.
7. Maintenance: Post-deployment, ongoing maintenance is crucial to fix bugs, make improvements, and adapt to evolving user needs or technologies. This includes regular updates and patches. 



** Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear, stable requirements and well-defined parameters, while Agile excels in dynamic environments where user feedback and adaptability are paramount. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology helps teams choose the right approach based on the nature of their project.
Waterfall methodology is characterized by its linear and sequential approach to project management. In this model, each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, creating a structured flow. Key features of Waterfall include an emphasis on thorough planning and extensive documentation, ensuring that every step is clearly defined.
Advantages of Waterfall include a clear structure, making it easier to manage due to its predictability and defined phases, and it is ideal for projects with established requirements that are unlikely to change.
Disadvantages consist of inflexibility, as once a phase is completed, it’s challenging to make changes, limiting adaptability. Additionally, late problem discovery often occurs, where issues surface only in later stages, causing potential setbacks.
Waterfall is appropriate for projects where requirements are well understood from the outset, such as regulatory compliance software or government contracts, where fixed deadlines and budgets are crucial.
Agile methodology is known for its iterative and incrementally flexible approach. Agile promotes collaboration, adaptability, and continuous feedback, dividing work into small, manageable increments called sprints. This allows for regular assessment and adjustment throughout the project lifecycle.
Advantages of Agile include flexibility, making it highly adaptable to changes in requirements, and regular feedback, enabling continuous user feedback to ensure that the final product meets actual user needs.
Disadvantages involve collaboration challenges since Agile requires close collaboration, which can be difficult in distributed teams. There is also potential chaos, as without proper management and structure, Agile can lead to disorganization and confusion.
Agile is particularly beneficial for projects with evolving requirements, such as mobile app development or start-ups seeking to validate ideas quickly. It’s also suitable for larger projects that require continuous integration and testing, like e-commerce platforms.
